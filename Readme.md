# 🏗️ Construction Permit Dashboard

## 📌 Project Overview
Welcome to my **Construction Permit Dashboard**, an interactive Tableau visualization designed to analyze and present **construction permit distributions and total valuations across U.S. states**. This project reflects my passion for **data visualization, business intelligence, and analytics**, providing insights into **construction trends, regional permitting patterns, and financial valuations**.

## 📊 Features
- **Total No. of Permits by State** – A **bubble chart** displaying the distribution of construction permits across states.
- **Valuations and No. of Permits Issued by State** – A **geospatial heatmap** that visualizes construction valuations alongside permit issuance.
- **Total Valuations (all units) by State** – A **scatter plot** that highlights valuation trends across states.
- **Total Valuations and Total No. of Permits by State** – A **treemap** offering an overview of valuation and permit numbers for different states.

## 🚀 Technologies Used
- **Tableau** – Used for dashboard creation and data visualization.
- **Mapbox/OpenStreetMap** – For interactive geospatial mapping.
- **Data Source** – [Kaggle dataset U.S. Census Bureau, local government records].

## 📂 Files Included
- **`Construction_Permit_Dashboard.twbx`** – Packaged Tableau workbook file containing all the visualizations.
- **`data_source.csv`** – Dataset used for visualization (if applicable).
- **`README.md`** – Project documentation.

## 🔍 How to Use
1. **Install Tableau Public or Tableau Desktop** (if you haven't already).
2. **Download and open the `Construction_Permit_Dashboard.twbx` file**.
3. **Interact with the dashboard** – Hover over charts, filter data, and analyze trends.

## 📈 Key Insights & Takeaways
- **Florida, California, and Texas** lead in the number of construction permits issued.
- **Valuations vary significantly by state**, with some states issuing fewer permits but having higher valuations.
- **Geospatial visualizations provide valuable insights into construction density and regional activity**.

## 💡 My Learning Experience
This project allowed me to:
- Strengthen my skills in **data visualization and geospatial analytics**.
- Enhance my ability to create **interactive dashboards** for real-world applications.
- Gain insights into **permit trends and valuation distributions**, helping stakeholders make data-driven decisions.
